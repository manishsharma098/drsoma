      question: "How should I prepare for Gynecomastia ?",
      answer:
        "Before surgery, your surgeon will provide specific instructions. These may include stopping certain medications, avoiding smoking, and arranging for someone to drive you home after the procedure. You may also undergo blood tests or other evaluations to ensure you’re fit for surgery.",
    },
    {
      question: "What type of anaesthesia is used for Gynecomastia?",
      answer:
        "Gynecomastia  is typically performed under general anaesthesia, meaning you will be fully asleep and feel no pain during the procedure. ",
    },
    {
      question: "Will I have visible scars after Gynecomastia?",
      answer:
        " The scars are hidden and not visible around the edges of the areola. Over time, scars will fade and become less noticeable. Your surgeon will also provide post-surgical care instructions to help minimize scar formation.",
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of results can I expect after Gynecomastia?",
      answer:
        "Most patients experience a flatter, firmer, and more masculine chest contour after Gynecomastia. Swelling and bruising are normal in the early stages of recovery, so the final results will become more apparent over the next few months as your body heals.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to recover from Gynecomastia?",
      answer:
        "Initial recovery from Gynecomastia usually takes about 1 to 2 weeks, during which you should rest and avoid strenuous activity. However, full recovery can take several weeks to a few months, depending on the extent of the surgery and how your body heals.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What are the possible complications after Gynecomastia?",
      answer:
        "As with any surgery, there are risks of complications such as infection, bleeding, scarring, or changes in nipple sensation. However, these are generally rare. If you notice signs of infection, increased pain, or unusual swelling, contact your doctor immediately.",

                  If you are a man struggling with enlarged breasts and it’s
                  affecting your confidence or comfort, Gynecomastia may
                  be the solution. Ideal candidates are healthy, of stable
                  weight, and have tried non-surgical alternatives without
                  success. Whether the issue is caused by excess fat, glandular
                  tissue, or a combination of both, this procedure can help
                  achieve a flatter, more masculine chest.

                    Gynecomastia, also known as male breast reduction,
                    is typically performed using one or a combination of two
                    techniques:

                    This is ideal for cases where the enlargement is primarily
                    due to excess fatty tissue.

                    In cases where glandular tissue or excess skin needs to be
                    removed, tissue excision is used. This method is also
                    applied if the areola needs reshaping or repositioning.

                  Recovery is straightforward. You will need to wear a
                  compression garment to reduce swelling and support healing for
                  a few weeks. Initial bruising and swelling are normal, but you
                  can return to daily activities within 1-2 weeks, although
                  strenuous physical activity should be avoided for 4-6 weeks
                  and full results visible after a few months as the swelling
                  subsides. Most patients experience a more defined chest and a
