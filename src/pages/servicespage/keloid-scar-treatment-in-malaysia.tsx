                  <p className="text-para-black">
                    When there has been an injury to the skin, a scar can
                    develop. Hypertrophic scars are scar tissue that is thick,
                    raised, and wide. While scars themselves are a common part
                    of the healing process of a wound, hypertrophic scars form
                    as a result of there being an abnormal response to skin
                    injury or trauma.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-para-black">
                    During the healing process, some people can produce an
                    over-abundance of collagen via myofibroblasts cells. This
                    commonly occurs when a wound has become inflamed, infected,
                    left on its own to heal with no stitches, or when the wound
                    is over a joint, putting it under a lot of motion and
                    tension. We frequently see this type of scarring with burn
                    injuries, but they can form from acne, piercings, and cuts.

                  <p className="text-para-black">
                    A keloid scar occurs when there is an excessive production
                    of scar tissue beyond the margins of the initial injury. In
                    these instances, the scar will form a keloid, a hard smooth
                    growth. A keloid can grow outside of the boundary of the
                    original wounded area. While they can appear on any area of
                    the body, the are more commonly seen on the shoulders,
                    chest, earlobes and groin.

                    milder and they won’t grow past the original are of the
                    injury. While these scars are not life-threatening or
                    dangerous, they can be painful, and itchy or simply a
                    cosmetic issue that people want to have minimized.

                    Applying Pressure – Pressure from a bandage or pressure
                    garment (stretchy material as Lycra/Tubigrip) can weaken the
                    scar tissue over time, greatly improving the appearance of
                    the scar. This pressure should be applied day and night for
                    up to months or even years.

                  <p className="text-para-black">
                    Silicone – This is a non-invasive treatment that uses
                    silicon in a sheet or gel form and is believed to help speed
                    up the repairing and healing of scar tissue. This is applied
                    after the wound has healed, directly to the skin. Depending
                    on the severity of the scar, silicone is usually worn for 12
                    to 24 hours each day and dan be used for long as 6 months.

                    Steroids (Triamcinolone) – Steroid injections tend to be the
                    first line of treatment for hypertrophic scarring. The
                    steroid is injected directly into the scar itself. This
                    treatment is done in intervals of four to six weeks and
                    helps the scar to soften and flatten. There are also scar
                    repairing creams that can be used, but you must seek advice
                    from your doctor, as using steroid treatments for too long
                    can weaken the normal skin tissue around the scar area.

                    Radiotherapy alone sometimes helps shrink the keloids.
