                    As we age, our skin begins to show signs of wear as we lose
                    collagen, which causes the skin to become less elastic and
                    sagging. To keep a youthful appearance, many people will
                    choose to have surgery. Some procedures are more invasive than
                    others, and permanent surgery may not be something you wish to
                    have. In this case, you can opt to have a thread lift, which
                    is a minimally invasive procedure that can be done in an hour
                    and doesn&apos;t involve permanent surgery.

                <p className="text-para-black">
                  Also called a &quot;thread face-lift&quot;, this minimally invasive
                  procedure is used to lift and realign sagging tissue, while
                  adding some definition to facial contours by using temporary
                  sutures. Instead of removing the patient&apos;s loose facial skin
                  surgically, our surgeon will simply suspend it by stitching up
                  portions of it. Facial fat that has dropped downwards is
                  brought up to his original position, so giving youthful looks
                  again. This has the effect of pulling the skin back slightly
                  and therefore lifting and tightening the face. In addition to
                  being ideal for lifting the skin, threads combat aging in
                  another way: by provoking the body&apos;s &quot;healing response&quot;
                  (Biostimulation) and causing the body to direct large surges
                  of collagen to treated areas.

                <p className="text-para-black">
                  This procedure is suitable for people with minimal signs of
                  aging who need just a small lift (usually women between 35 and
                  55). Others include those who have had some relapse from a
                  previous procedure such as facelift/neck lift. Thread lifts
                  can treat: Hollow cheeks – where there has been a loss of
                  volume from the cheeks. Jowls – where the skin sags around the
                  jawline. Sagging cheeks – where there has been mild to
                  moderate sagging. Deep wrinkles – where lines and folds have
                  appeared around the nose and chin.

                  How is a thread lift procedure done?
                </h5>
                <p className="text-para-black">
                  The procedure can be done with local anesthesia and is
                  generally done within one to two hours. It involves the
                  insertion of very fine threads into the face or neck through
                  very tiny incisions or needles. The threads work to pull back
                  the skin, which lifts it to give the skin a smoother
                  appearance. The results of this procedure are immediate, with
                  sagging skin being eliminated and giving you a more youthful
                  and rejuvenated appearance. The thread lift procedure begins
                  with making a tiny notch behind the ear or hairline. A needle
                  is then inserted into the skin when the suspending threads
                  attached to it. The needle has very fine threads with even
                  finer filaments that can attach themselves to the tissue under
                  the skin. As the needle is withdrawn, these filaments get
                  deposited into the sagging areas. The threads are then
                  tightened to lift sagging skin giving it a smooth and natural
                  look. A thread lift procedure creates longer-lasting results
                  than you would get with dermal fillers or a Botox treatment.

                  polypropylene strand are used. They contain a number of
                  sutures interspersed with tiny &quot;cones&quot; that are adept at
                  grabbing tissue all around. This allows the threads to gather
                  more skin, producing a more noticeable lift to the cheeks and
                  jowls that lasts up to 5 years. (by Menarini)

                  This procedure uses a monofilament, absorbable skin
                  support/filling thread of synthetic origin. The Happy Lift,
                  sutures interact with the tissues with. creating a double
                  action: 1. Lifting action for the support & repositioning of
                  the tissues. 2. Revitalizing action stimulating the synthesis
                  of collagen, hyaluronic acid, and elastin. (Biostimulation)
                  Furthermore, a fibrous capsule occurs around the inserted
                  thread that prolongs the lifting effect and maintains the skin
                  traction. It also protects the thread from hydrolysis,
                  extending its permanence in the tissue.

                  Swelling and bruising may occur and can be prevented with ice

                  patient is advised to sleep on the back for a week. Otherwise,
                  it will undo the effect of the procedure. Finally, the patient
                  should avoid excessive mouth opening and massage on the
                  operated site for about 3 weeks. Some patients experience
                  numbness in the treated area, which usually subsides within 1
                  week of the procedure.

                  Thread lift procedures have become popular because there is a

                  general anesthesia is not required and the risk of
