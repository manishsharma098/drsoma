                    Having excess fat and skin around the abdomen can be
                    frustrating, especially if you&apos;ve worked hard to lose weight
                    and can&apos;t seem to shift those last few pounds. You don&apos;t have
                    to live with excess abdominal skin and fat though. Opting for
                    a tummy tuck, or abdominoplasty will help rid you of the
                    excess fat and skin while giving a flatter and more toned
                    look.

                  What is Abdominoplasty or Tummy Tuck?
                </h5>
                <p className="text-para-black">
                  Tummy Tuck is a surgical procedure to remove excess skin and
                  fat from the abdomen and to enhance physical beauty by
                  tightening the muscles of the abdominal wall. This procedure
                  can be combined with Bilateral Breast Augmentation,
                  Liposuction & Facelift. Having loose skin on the abdomen can
                  be a result of a few things, such as having lost a lot of
                  weight, or after pregnancy, where the stretched skin and
                  muscles have become slack. It&apos;s also an option for those who
                  have scarring after having had abdominal surgery.

                <p className="text-para-black">
                  A tummy tuck won&apos;t help you lose weight, control it, or stop
                  you from future weight gain. The purpose is to tone the body
                  and improve the shape of the abdomen.

                <p className="text-para-black">
                  The ideal candidate for tummy tuck in Malaysia is anyone with
                  loose skin and excess fat in the upper tummy, excess fatty
                  tissue especially in the lower abdomen and flanks, damaged
                  lower abdominal skin (especially women with stretch marks
                  after multiple pregnancies                  ) & those with &apos;loosening&apos; or
                  &apos;bulging&apos; of the abdomen caused by stretching of the muscles
                  and tissue of the abdominal wall that is deeper to the skin
                  and fat layer.

                  Who Should Not Consider a Tummy Tuck?
                </h5>
                <p className="text-para-black">
                  If you are planning on becoming pregnant again or losing a
                  large amount of weight, you shouldn&apos;t consider having a tummy
                  tuck. This is because both can lead to more excess skin and
                  stretch marks, which means you would need to have a second
                  procedure. Also, if you are a heavy smoker, extremely
                  overweight, or have had issues with blood clotting on the
                  past, this procedure may not be suitable for you.

                  How is the Tummy Tuck procedure done?
                </h5>
                <div className="flex flex-col gap-5">
                  <p className="text-para-black">
                    There are two types of tummy tuck procedures that can be
                    done; a partial tummy tuck and a full extended tummy tuck.
                    Both use a general anesthetic during the procedure and
                    involves excising all the skin and fat layer below the
                    umbilicus, closure of the weakened abdominal wall muscles
                    and the hernia if it is present. In ladies, this will
                    enhance their hourglass figure. The skin above the umbilicus
                    is now stretched and sutured to the hair-bearing skin in the
                    pubis. The umbilicus is now brought out to its new location
                    through a new defect made out in the skin and sutured in
                    place.

                <p className="text-para-black">
                  After the operation, you will experience some pain and
                  discomfort, which can be controlled with pain medication. You
                  will need to wear a compression garment for several weeks to
                  help with swelling and support the healing process. You should
                  avoid strenuous activities and heavy lifting for at least 6
                  weeks. The scars will initially be red and raised but will
                  fade over time. You may experience some numbness in the
                  treated area, which usually resolves within a few months.

                </h5>
                <p className="text-para-black">
                  The benefits of a tummy tuck include a flatter, more toned
                  abdomen, improved body contour, enhanced self-confidence, and
                  better fitting clothes. It can also help with posture and
                  reduce back pain caused by weak abdominal muscles. The
                  procedure can be life-changing for those who have struggled
                  with excess skin and fat in the abdominal area.
